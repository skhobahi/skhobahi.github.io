Hi! My name is Shahin Khobahi, and welcome to my website!

I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specilization in the fields of **artificial intelligence**, **mathematical optimization**, **signal processing**, and **information theory**. During my academic studies, I have worked on foundations of model-based deep learning with
applications in various signal processing fields such as communication systems, compressive sensing, phase retrieval, radar signal processing, and image processing.

Here, you'll find some of my thoughts, works, and blog posts on machine learning, signal processing, information theory, mathematical optimization, and financial economics.
